            q: "What is excretion? Explain the process of excretion in humans.",
            a: "Excretion is the process of removal of metabolic waste products from the body. In humans, excretion mainly occurs through the kidneys. Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery, gets filtered in the nephron (the functional unit). Useful substances are reabsorbed, and waste (urea, excess water, salts) forms urine. Urine passes through the ureter to the urinary bladder and is expelled through the urethra.",

            q: "Draw a labelled diagram of the structure of the kidney (Nephron).",
            a: "A nephron consists of: (1) Bowman's capsule – cup-shaped structure surrounding the glomerulus. (2) Glomerulus – a network of blood capillaries where filtration occurs. (3) Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) – reabsorption of glucose, amino acids. (4) Loop of Henle – reabsorption of water. (5) Distal convoluted tubule (DCT) – selective reabsorption and secretion. (6) Collecting duct – collects urine. [Draw and label these parts for full marks.]",

(2) Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) – cranial nerves and spinal nerves; connects CNS to organs. (3) Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) – controls involuntary functions (heartbeat, digestion); divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.",

            q: "What is the function of insulin hormone? Which gland secretes it?",
            a: "Insulin is secreted by the beta cells of the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Function: Insulin regulates blood glucose levels by promoting the uptake of glucose by body cells for energy and stimulating the liver to convert excess glucose into glycogen (glycogenesis). Deficiency of insulin causes diabetes mellitus.",

(2) Midbrain – controls eye movements and visual/auditory reflexes. (3) Hindbrain – includes cerebellum (balance and coordination), pons (breathing regulation), and medulla oblongata (controls heartbeat, breathing, and other involuntary actions).

          {
            q: "What is a reflex action? Explain with an example.",
            a: "A reflex action is an involuntary and instantaneous response to a stimulus, controlled by the spinal cord without involving the brain. The pathway taken is called the reflex arc. Example: When you accidentally touch a hot object, sensory nerves send a signal to the spinal cord, which immediately sends a motor signal back to the hand muscles to withdraw the hand, even before the brain registers pain. This protects the body from injury.",

(2) It reabsorbs useful substances like glucose, amino acids, and water back into the blood. (3) It regulates water balance and blood pressure. (4) It maintains pH of the blood. Each kidney contains about 1 million nephrons.",

            q: "What is dialysis? When is it required?",
            a: "Dialysis is an artificial process of filtering waste products from the blood, performed when the kidneys fail to function properly. In dialysis, the patient's blood is passed through a dialysis machine (artificial kidney) which has a semi-permeable membrane. Waste products diffuse out while blood cells and proteins remain in the blood. It is required in cases of: (1) Chronic kidney failure, (2) Acute renal failure, (3) When kidney transplant is awaited.",

            a: "Heredity is the transmission of genetic traits (characteristics) from parents to offspring through genes. Gregor Mendel's experiments on pea plants are important because: (1) He established the basic laws of inheritance. (2) He introduced the concept of dominant and recessive traits. (3) He showed that traits are inherited in a predictable ratio. (4) His work laid the foundation of modern genetics.",

          {
            q: "State Mendel's laws of heredity.",
            a: "Mendel proposed three laws: (1) Law of Dominance: When two different alleles are present, only the dominant allele expresses itself; the recessive is masked. (2) Law of Segregation: During gamete formation, the two alleles of a gene separate so each gamete carries only one allele. (3) Law of Independent Assortment: Genes for different traits are inherited independently of each other during gamete formation.",

            q: "What is a gene? How does it affect the characteristics of an organism?",
            a: "A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for a specific protein or trait. Genes are located on chromosomes in the cell nucleus. Each gene controls the synthesis of a specific protein (enzyme or structural protein), which in turn determines a particular characteristic of the organism (e.g., eye colour, blood group, height). Genes are inherited from both parents, and their combination determines the organism's phenotype.",

            q: "What is Darwin's theory of Natural Selection?",
            a: "Darwin's theory of Natural Selection states: (1) Organisms produce more offspring than can survive. (2) There is natural variation among individuals. (3) Individuals with favourable variations are better adapted to the environment and survive (survival of the fittest). (4) Survivors reproduce and pass on favourable traits to offspring. (5) Over many generations, favourable traits accumulate, leading to evolution of new species.",

            q: "How is sex determination done? Write the importance of XX and XY chromosomes.",
            a: "Sex determination in humans is based on sex chromosomes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX) and males have one X and one Y chromosome (XY). During gamete formation, females always produce X-bearing eggs, while males produce both X-bearing and Y-bearing sperm. If a Y-bearing sperm fertilises the egg, the offspring is male (XY); if an X-bearing sperm fertilises the egg, the offspring is female (XX). So, the father determines the sex of the child.",
